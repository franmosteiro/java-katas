# Overview
This kata is about implementation of Fibonacci sequence in a form of iterator and stream.

# Problem description
> The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
> 
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
> 
> The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
>
> * The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
> * The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
> * And the 5 is (2+3), and so on!

## Small steps
Once upon a time a teacher stated a problem before his students. I want you to print on console Fibonacci Sequence.

Students smiled to themselves: - Pice of cake. We already implemented Fibonacci using recursion and while loops.

The teacher said with a cunning glint in his eye: - "Sequence" - that's the key. Please create an iterator for Fibonacci Sequence.

##Walking
The teacher continued: Once you will have the iterator the next part of the exercise should be easy. Now create the stream of Fibonacci numbers.
