# The OddEven Kata
* Write a program that prints numbers within specified range lets say 1 to 100. 
* If number is odd print 'Odd' instead of the number. 
* If number is even print 'Even' instead of number. 
* Else print number [hint - if number is Prime].

## Kata steps
* Prints numbers from 1 to 100
* Print "Even" instead of number, if the number is even, (i.e. divisible by 2)
* Print "Odd" instead of number, if the number is odd, (i.e. not divisible by 2 but not divisible by itself too)
* Print number, if it does not meet above two conditions, (i.e. if number is Prime)
* Make method to accept any number of range [currently  we have 1 to 100]
* Create a new method to check Odd/Even/Prime of a single supplied method
